# This code runs a basic comparison of sqlite and pandas.

To install, please run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need pandas installed (which usually can't be installed from pip.  Consider using [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/)).

To run the file, run
```
./driver.sh results/run1
```
to output the results.  More results can be found in `memory.sh`.

An ipython notebook analysis can be found in the folder `analysis`.
